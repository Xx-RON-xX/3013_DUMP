# üìÅ P01 ‚Äì Public Key Cryptography: ElGamal Algorithm

## üß† Overview

This project explains the core principles of **Public Key Cryptography (PKC)** with a special focus on the **ElGamal encryption algorithm**. Public key cryptography, also called asymmetric cryptography, allows for secure communication by using mathematically linked **public** and **private keys**.

Data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by its paired private key. Similarly, data signed with a private key can be verified by the corresponding public key, enabling both **confidentiality** and **authenticity**.

## üîê Algorithms Covered

| Algorithm | Security Basis             | Key Size (Typical) | Time Complexity    | Use Cases                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| RSA       | Integer Factorization       | 2048+ bits         | O(log¬≥ n)          | SSL/TLS, digital signatures         |
| ECC       | Elliptic Curve Log Problem  | 256+ bits          | O(n)               | Mobile crypto, blockchain (e.g. BTC)|
| ElGamal   | Discrete Logarithm Problem  | 2048+ bits         | O(log¬≥ p)          | GPG, secure messaging               |

## üõ†Ô∏è How ElGamal Works

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Choose a large prime \( p \) and generator \( g \)
   - Select private key \( x \in [1, p-2] \)
   - Compute public key: \( h = g^x \mod p \)

2. **Encryption**:
   - For message \( m \) and random \( k \):
     - \( c_1 = g^k \mod p \)
     - \( c_2 = m \cdot h^k \mod p \)

3. **Decryption**:
   - Compute \( s = c_1^x \mod p \)
   - Recover \( m = c_2 \cdot s^{-1} \mod p \)

## üìç Where It's Used
